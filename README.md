# Consolidation Plus README

# README for Consolidation Project Plus by Denise Bryant

# This program is the same program as the last consolidation project, just with timing enhancements. 
# This program is a game where you roll three dice, get points with the numbers you roll, and try to reach 50 points without getting 3 of the same numbers in a row
# The code asks if you would like to roll the dice, If you click yes, it'll output 3 random numbers. If you click no, the code will output the number of points you get, which is 0
# Once you run the code, the timer will start, tracking the date and time the game is being played.
# If you get 3 numbers in a row, that means you "tuple out" and go no points
# If you roll the dice and two of the three dice are the same, you cannot reroll those dice. These dice are considered fixed dice.
# You can choose to reroll the "non fixed" dice to improve your score
# At the end of each turn, your score is the sum of all the dice.
# It will also output how long you have played the game.
# If you reach 50 without tupling out, you win the game.
# Once you no longer want to play, it will ask, "Do you want to continue playing?"
# When you click no, you have reached the end of the game.
# At the end of the game, you will recieve a game summary of the amount of point you earned and the time and date you played the game, showing how long you have played it.
